    Dear <%= @user.name.split.first %>,
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for adopting one of Lafayette's 1,500 catch basins/storm
    drains and keeping it free of leaves and debris. You are joining your
    neighbors in helping to protect the environment, manage stormwater, and
    minimize flooding.
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em">How to Care For Your Adopted Drain</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      If possible, clear the drain before and after it rains.
    </li>
    <li>
      Put leaves and other natural material in the green compost bin.
    </li>
    <li>
      Put trash in the black garbage bin.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clear about 10 feet on both sides of the drain.
    </li>
    <li>
      Medical waste or needles? Construction debris? Drain clogged underneath
      the grate? <a href="https://www.311lafayette.services/en-US/interaction-type-deflection/?id=7ad30d02-c80b-ea11-a9a0-001dd8308047">Report to 311</a> to have it handled by the City.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em">Drain Cleaning Safety Tips</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Never try to lift the drain grate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clear from the sidewalk, not the street.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wear reflective clothing so vehicles can see you.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always wear gloves and be very careful of sharp objects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a rake, broom, or shovel - not your hands.
    </li>
  </ul>

    training. We also send periodic email reminders to clear your drains.
